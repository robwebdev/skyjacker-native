# Skyjacker Native


Skyjacker is a location-based, augmented reality flight tracking game. The current version [available on the AppStore](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/skyjacker-we-own-the-skies/id1177542567) is built using Cordova. The purpose of this repo is to explore React Native as a potential framework for a later build of Skyjacker (or a related app), plus provide code examples to those interested.


**This won't run locally for you without the correct API keys.** [Instead, a demo is available via Expo.io](https://expo.io/@robwebdev/skyjacker).
